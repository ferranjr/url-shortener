# Url Shortener
This is a toy project to experiment with RUST, in this case working directly with
[hyper.rs](https://hyper.rs/) to build a small rest API to get short urls.

As storage I am using MongoDB

TODO: 
1. Need to add how to run locally, but first need to automate user and index creation for mongodb
2. Testing, been playing around many new things and follow many examples, so testing and refactoring is next goal
3. Metrics, adding metrics and bringing a grafana/prometheus set up for experimentation
4. Bring some load testing to verify metrics, goose set up from my rocket tests can be a starting point
